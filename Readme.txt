READ these instructions first before running any of the included code\
\
The data files are divided into three groups \'97 \'93climate_data\'94, \'93emission_data\'94 and \'93energy_consumption_data\'94, these data files are in seperate folders with human readable names.\
\
Please ensure that the names of each folder is identical as the names shown above before proceeding. Please do not move any files out of the directory which may cause unexpected errors.\
\
To run these code, Python 3.5 and above should be installed on your computer, along with Jupyter Notebook and Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn third party libraries.\
\
You can install Jupyter Notebook by running the following commands in your terminal.\
\
pip3 -install ipython_notebook\
\
After launching Jupyter Notebook, locate the files in your directories and run the code by opening \'93Phase 3 Final Code.ipynb\'94. Click \'93run all\'94 in the file section.\
\
Three other seperate .ipynb files are also included, each has code for preprocessing each section of the data files.\
